This example shows the calculation of a simple straight microstrip line. Execute InductEx with:

>inductex lman1.gds -l ixman1.ldf -i lman1.inp -fh

The solution file (sol_ffh.txt) is included. Your results should match this.

You can vary parameters in the layer definition file (ixman1.ldf) and observe the effects on calculations results.

The above command runs InductEx with the FFH engine, which processes cuboid meshes.

You can run the same example with the TetraHenry engine to use a tetrahedral mesh. For this,
Gmsh has to be installed and available on the path.

>inductex lman1.gds -l ixman1.ldf -i lman1.geo -th

The solution file is included as sol_tth.txt.

Finally, this example contains demonstrations of parameter sweeps defined in the .control block of the netlist file,
lman1_sweep.cir. InductEx uses the name of the layout file as default for the netlist file. If the names differ,
the netlist file has to be specified with -n command line parameter:

>inductex lman1.gds -l ixman1.ldf -i lman1.inp -fh -n lman1_sweep.cir

The solution file is included as sol_sweep.txt

You can uncomment the other sweep statements to investigate these.
