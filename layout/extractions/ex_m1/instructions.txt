This example shows the calculation the self inductances of an RSFQ cell. Execute InductEx (which requires "inductex.exe" and "fasthenry.exe" in the PATH or in the same directory, with:

>inductex Hyp_split_demo.gds -l h4k5.ldf -i split.inp -fh


The solution file (sol.txt) is included. Your results should match this.

Note that we set the design value of the dc bias inductance (Lib1), which is a "don't care" value
in this layout, to 0. InductEx then ignores it when calculating "PercDiff", the percentage difference
between design and extracted values. Also, in the layer definition file "h4k5.ldf", we set 
 "GPOverhang =  5.0"
to show how the moats are handled during modelling. The ground plane extends around any moats that
"penetrate" into the GPOverhang zone around conductive layers. In this example, resistance is neglected
and the resistors are therefore not segmented (but metal flow over resistors are respected - see the 
attached 3D rendering).

The IDensity parameter on layer I1C also sets the Josephson junction area definition layer, and its
critical current density. Josephson junction critical currents are thus calculated.

To generate the 3D rendering included in this example zip file, use "inp2dxf.exe" (which should
be in the PATH or in the same directory) with:

>inp2dxf split.inp split.dxf -h 5

(You can use any name for the DXF file. The "-h" parameter sets the vertical dimension scaling,
which we set to 5 here to make the thin-films thicker for viewing.)
