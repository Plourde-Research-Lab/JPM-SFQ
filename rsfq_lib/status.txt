NOTES:

The AND gate does not have circuit element values provided.
The B flip-flop is more of a concept than an actual useful circuit.

"DONE" means that the test circuit illustrates correct operation of
the circuit, and no more work on that circuit is anticipated.

"NOT DONE" means that implementation of the circuit element is not
yet at the "DONE" status, but is in progress or intended to be done.

Note that some functions are duplicated from the SUNY and Ilmenau
libraries.  It is too early to tell which implementation is "better",
but in general the Ilmenau circuits appear to have advantages, such as
avoiding the need for a negative current source in the T flip-flop.

All cells can be freely mixed (as far as I can tell at present).
